    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Full Stack Web Developer specializing in ConcreteCMS, LAMP
      environments, accessible and data-driven web solutions. My experience
      spans the full development lifecycle — from server setup and backend
      integration to front-end design, debugging, and deployment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I focus on creating maintainable, secure, and high-performing websites
      that align with accessibility standards and organizational goals. Beyond
      coding, I write technical documentation, provide training for content
      authors and developers, and contribute to process automation using Python
      and modern testing frameworks.
